# Owner Overcharge Visibility - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved: "How do I know if my vehicle has overcharges as an owner?"

You raised an excellent point about owner visibility. As an owner, you now have **real-time monitoring** of your rented vehicles and overcharge status.

## 🎯 What You Can Now See as an Owner

### 1. **Booking List Page** (`/owner/bookings`)
- ✅ **At-a-glance status** of all your bookings
- ✅ **🟢 Active Rental** badge for vehicles currently rented (on time)
- ✅ **⚠️ Potential Overcharges** badge for overdue rentals
- ✅ **Real-time indicators** show which vehicles need attention

### 2. **Individual Booking Detail Page** (`/owner/bookings/{id}`)
- ✅ **🚗 Live Tracking & Overcharge Monitoring** section for active rentals
- ✅ **Time Remaining** counter (shows if overdue)
- ✅ **Current Overcharge Status** with detailed breakdown
- ✅ **Real-time alerts** for:
  - ⏰ Late Return overcharges
  - 🏙️ Out of City overcharges
- ✅ **Refresh Status** button to get latest information
- ✅ **Contact Renter** button for immediate communication

### 3. **Overcharge Statistics Page** (`/owner/overcharges/stats`)
- ✅ **Summary dashboard** with total earned, unpaid amounts, late returns, out-of-city violations
- ✅ **Recent overcharges table** showing all applied overcharges
- ✅ **Mark as Paid** functionality for collected overcharges

## 🔄 How Real-Time Monitoring Works

### **Automatic Detection**
1. **Late Return**: System automatically detects when current time passes the expected return time
2. **Out of City**: Detected when vehicle is returned outside Surigao City GPS boundaries
3. **Status Updates**: Information refreshes when you click "Refresh Status" or reload the page

### **Visual Indicators**
- 🟢 **Green**: Vehicle on time, no issues
- ⚠️ **Yellow/Red**: Potential or active overcharges detected
- 📱 **Contact Button**: Direct access to renter's phone/email

### **Proactive Management**
- **Early Warning**: See potential overcharges before they're applied
- **Direct Communication**: Contact renter immediately if issues arise
- **Extension Monitoring**: See if renter extended their booking to avoid overcharges

## 📍 GPS & Location Tracking

### **Out of City Detection**
- System uses **GPS coordinates** when vehicle is returned
- Compares return location against **Surigao City boundaries**
- Automatically calculates **distance-based overcharges**
- Shows **return location name** for verification

### **Location Boundaries**
- **Surigao City Limits**: Predefined GPS polygon
- **Base Rate**: ₱X for going out of city
- **Per KM Rate**: Additional ₱X per kilometer outside city

2. **"Booking Requests"** → See all bookings with status indicators
